# Better Tracks

This mod is an example Fabric 1.20.1 addon using the Create mod. It adds a **Waypoint Wand** item. Hold the wand and right‑click blocks to mark waypoints. Each click draws a particle line from the previous point. Double‑click the last block to finalize the path and clear the points.

The Create jar (`create-fabric-0.5.1-j-build.1631+mc1.20.1.jar`) must be placed in `run/mods` when developing.
