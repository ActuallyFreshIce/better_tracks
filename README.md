# Better Tracks

This mod is an example Fabric 1.20.1 addon using the Create mod. It lets you mark waypoints by right‑clicking blocks. Each click draws a particle line from the previous point. Double‑clicking ends the path and clears the waypoints.

The Create jar (`create-fabric-0.5.1-j-build.1631+mc1.20.1.jar`) must be placed in `run/mods` when developing.
